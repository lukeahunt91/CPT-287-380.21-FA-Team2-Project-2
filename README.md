## Project Description
This project uses stacks to evaluate an infix expression. This parser supports aritmetic and logical operators (^, *, /, %, +, -, >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=, &&, ||) and respects parenthesis.

Expression(s) are read from an input file and the results are evaluated and output to the standard console.    
   
   
   
Project assumes all operands are integers. Division uses integer division (will not return decimals). Will return an error instead of crashing upon an invalid operator/divide-by-zero error.
